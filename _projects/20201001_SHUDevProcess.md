The aim of this project is to design a software development process that can be “instantiated” into the different levels of Software Engineering and Computer Science courses.
The core of this is a development process that uses a simplified software lifecycle.

Our proposal structures and standardises key activities that students undertake when doing their software development coursework, including simple project management guidance that works for both individuals and small groups working remotely.
Complexity can be added to a simple process according to the level of study, in which we add relevant tools and techniques as students progress through their degree and are better able to understand and apply those tools and techniques.

The process will be more useful to our students if it fits into the assessment of their work. The second part of this project is to define structured ways in which students can present and submit their work. By following a simple process, even those with poor study skills will be better able to showcase their learning.
